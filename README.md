# CompilerConstructionWithPLY
I created a compiler (lexer and parser) in python with the help of PLY for a mini language that I developed with some classmates of mine.
This was for a school project to learn step by step how a compiler works. I had trouble with the Intermediate Code Generator. 
Anyone who sees this may get use of it and may maybe help me as well in perfecting it.
